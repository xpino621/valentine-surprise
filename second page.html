        Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everything else disappears.
        
        From the moment you walked into my life, it’s like the world faded, leaving only you, radiant, beautiful😍, hot 🔥and impossible to ignore. Every moment with you feels like a gift, and I am endlessly grateful for your love.
        
        You are my confidante, my biggest inspiration, and a sweet part of my life. I love you more than words can ever describe.
        
        Although words may fall short, my heart never does. Every heartbeat echoes your name, and With every beat of my heart, I find myself falling for you all over again. You’ve woven yourself into the very fabric of my heart, and life without you is unimaginable.
        
        I still remember the first time I truly saw you, not just with my eyes, but with my heart. It was like the universe paused for a moment to let me realize, “This is the one.” Since then, you’ve been my calm in the chaos, my laughter in the silence, and the reason behind my quiet and loud smiles.
        
        I love the way your eyes light up when you talk about your dreams, the passion in your voice when you share your heart, and the gentle strength you carry even when life gets tough. 
        You’re not just beautiful, you’re breathtaking, inside and out.
        
        <p> I could, I’d capture every moment with you in words, but even the most beautiful poems would fall short.
         So instead, I’ll spend my days showing you with every hug, kisses,  every whisper, every little act of love,
          just how much you mean to me.</p>
        Thank you for being an amazing woman
        
        Even if you’re a goat😩,
        I still love you so muchhh and I can’t wait spend life with you, building a beautiful home and future for us.
        I love you Olori mi, I love you Toluwalashe❤
        <p>God bless you real good and keep us together in love and peace, and strength in Jesus name.</p>
